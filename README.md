# Introduction:
In large blocks of code, it's essential to know to make any maintenance activity. if it’s particularly governed by if-else statements in large code blocks its increases spatial distance between the if-statement and else equivalent or other dependent else-statements. It’s hard for the developers to recall the if logical expression that he has just read and understood .so he needs to go back and read it again. In most cases, if-else pair might occur in different pages so developers have to scroll up and down to gossip them both. Furthermore. It needs to understand else implicit negated expression he might want to go back to the farthest if-statements and understand the cumulative logical expression all he makes understanding if-else even harder.
# Important:
Its importance is to simply hover on the else distant conditions and helps to simplify them. Its great feature to compare of if statements it's else counterpart in large code blocks.
# Motivation:
To understand else implicit expression in the large code block. most of the cases developers have a large block of code with multilevel logical expression with if else-statements there is hard to know which else-statement of which if-statement part. So simply hover gives the feature just hover on it and its also applying negation to get the simpler condition.

# Methodology :
We take an unsplit method of java from JEdit in which we have 3 else-statements in large blocks of code for comprehending else blocks we used simply hover plug-in tool in Eclipse IDE that brings the if condition next to its else counterpart. simply hover presents to the developer to know hover over else the if conditions in their negated form and even lets him own simplification for that.
# Result:
We get it very useful for developers to understand the large code of blocks of comprehension of else-statements. Simply hover brings to else the distant conditions and helps to simplify them.
